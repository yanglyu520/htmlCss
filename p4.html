  <h2 id="one">Flying saucers and Project Blue Book</h2>
  <p>The first well-known UFO sighting occurred in 1947, when businessman Kenneth Arnold claimed to see a group of nine
  high-speed objects near Mount Rainier in Washington while flying his small plane. Arnold estimated the speed of the
  crescent-shaped objects as several thousand miles per hour and said they moved “like saucers skipping on water.” In the
  newspaper report that followed, it was mistakenly stated that the objects were saucer-shaped, hence the term flying
  saucer.</p>

  <p>Sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena increased, and in 1948 the U.S. Air Force began an investigation of these
  reports called Project Sign. The initial opinion of those involved with the project was that the UFOs were most likely
  sophisticated Soviet aircraft, although some researchers suggested that they might be spacecraft from other worlds, the
  so-called extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH). Within a year, Project Sign was succeeded by Project Grudge, which in 1952
  was itself replaced by the longest-lived of the official inquiries into UFOs, Project Blue Book, headquartered at
  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. From 1952 to 1969 Project Blue Book compiled reports of more than
  12,000 sightings or events, each of which was ultimately classified as (1) “identified” with a known
  astronomical,atmospheric, or artificial (human-caused) phenomenon or (2) “unidentified.” The latter category,
  approximately 6 percent of the total, included cases for which there was insufficient information to make an
  identification with a known phenomenon.</p>
  
  
  <h2 id="two">The Robertson Panel and the Condon Report</h2>
  An American obsession with the UFO phenomenon was under way. In the hot summer of 1952 a provocative series of radar and
  visual sightings occurred near National Airport in Washington, D.C. Although these events were attributed to temperature
  inversions in the air over the city, not everyone was convinced by this explanation. Meanwhile, the number of UFO
  reports had climbed to a record high. This led the Central Intelligence Agency to prompt the U.S. government to
  establish an expert panel of scientists to investigate the phenomena. The panel was headed by H.P. Robertson, a
  physicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, and included other physicists, an
  astronomer, and a rocket engineer. The Robertson Panel met for three days in 1953 and interviewed military officers and
  the head of Project Blue Book. They also reviewed films and photographs of UFOs. Their conclusions were that (1) 90
  percent of the sightings could be easily attributed to astronomical and meteorologic phenomena (e.g., bright planets and
  stars, meteors, auroras, ion clouds) or to such earthly objects as aircraft, balloons, birds, and searchlights, (2)
  there was no obvious security threat, and (3) there was no evidence to support the ETH. Parts of the panel’s report were
  kept classified until 1979, and this long period of secrecy helped fuel suspicions of a government cover-up.
  
  A second committee was set up in 1966 at the request of the Air Force to review the most interesting material gathered
  by Project Blue Book. Two years later this committee, which made a detailed study of 59 UFO sightings, released its
  results as Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects—also known as the Condon Report, named for Edward U. Condon,
  the physicist who headed the investigation. The Condon Report was reviewed by a special committee of the National
  Academy of Sciences. A total of 37 scientists wrote chapters or parts of chapters for the report, which covered
  investigations of the 59 UFO sightings in detail. Like the Robertson Panel, the committee concluded that there was no
  evidence of anything other than commonplace phenomena in the reports and that UFOs did not warrant further
  investigation. This, together with a decline in sighting activity, led to the dismantling of Project Blue Book in 1969.
  
  <h2 id="three">Other investigations of UFOs</h2>
  Despite the failure of the ETH to make headway with the expert committees, a few scientists and engineers, most notably
  J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, who had been involved with projects
  Sign, Grudge, and Blue Book, concluded that a small fraction of the most-reliable UFO reports gave definite indications
  for the presence of extraterrestrial visitors. Hynek founded the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), which continues to
  investigate the phenomenon. Another major U.S. study of UFO sightings was the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification
  Program (AATIP), a secret project that ran from 2007 to 2012. When the existence of the AATIP was made public in
  December 2017, the most newsworthy aspect of it was a report that the U.S. government possessed alloys and compounds
  purportedly attained from UFOs that were of unidentifiable nature, but many scientists remained skeptical about this
  claim.
  
  
  Aside from the American efforts, the only other official and fairly complete records of UFO sightings were kept in
  Canada, where they were transferred in 1968 from the Canadian Department of National Defense to the Canadian National
  Research Council. The Canadian records comprised about 750 sightings. Less-complete records have been maintained in the
  United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, and Greece. In the United States, CUFOS and the Mutual UFO Network in
  Bellvue, Colorado, continue to log sightings reported by the public.
  
  In the Soviet Union, sightings of UFOs were often prompted by tests of secret military rockets. In order to obscure the
  true nature of the tests, the government sometimes encouraged the public’s belief that these rockets might be
  extraterrestrial craft but eventually decided that the descriptions themselves might give away too much information. UFO
  sightings in China have been similarly provoked by military activity that is unknown to the public.
  
  <h2 id="four">Possible explanations for UFO sightings and alien abductions</h2>
  UFO reports have varied widely in reliability, as judged by the number of witnesses, whether the witnesses were
  independent of each other, the observing conditions (e.g., fog, haze, type of illumination), and the direction of
  sighting. Typically, witnesses who take the trouble to report a sighting consider the object to be of extraterrestrial
  origin or possibly a military craft but certainly under intelligent control. This inference is usually based on what is
  perceived as formation flying by sets of objects, unnatural—often sudden—motions, the lack of sound, changes in
  brightness or colour, and strange shapes.
  
  That the unaided eye plays tricks is well known. A bright light, such as the planet Venus, often appears to move.
  Astronomical objects can also be disconcerting to drivers, as they seem to “follow” the car. Visual impressions of
  distance and speed of UFOs are also highly unreliable because they are based on an assumed size and are often made
  against a blank sky with no background object (clouds, mountains, etc.) to set a maximum distance. Reflections from
  windows and eyeglasses produce superimposed views, and complex optical systems, such as camera lenses, can turn point
  sources of light into apparently saucer-shaped phenomena. Such optical illusions and the psychological desire to
  interpret images are known to account for many visual UFO reports, and at least some sightings are known to be hoaxes.
  Radar sightings, while in certain respects more reliable, fail to discriminate between artificial objects and meteor
  trails, ionized gas, rain, or thermal discontinuities in the atmosphere. <br>
